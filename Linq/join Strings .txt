Ok, here's a guess. I just typed this into LinqPad:

--
From x in Enumerable.Empty(Of String)().AsQueryable()
Select x + " " + x
--

And got this as the equivalent expression tree (sorry, LinqPad show this C#-y):

--
System.String[]
   .Select (x => String.Concat (x, " ", x))
--

Then I typed this:

--
From x in Enumerable.Empty(Of String)().AsQueryable()
Select x + " " + x
--

And the expression tree became:

--
System.String[]
   .Select (x => String.Concat (new String[] { x, " ", x, " ", x } ))
--
